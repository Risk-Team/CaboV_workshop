## Introduction to the cloud-based environment CAVA Analytics to work with CORDEX-CORE climate models and other R libraries to access, analyse and visualize netCDF files

In this workshop we will learn how to use CAVA Analytics to access, analyse and visualize CORDEX-CORE climate models for any location in the world. We will also explore some R libraries that can be used to access the COPERNICUS marine data store. The workshop will allow partrecipants to understand how to use cloud-based services to perform meaningful analysis with netCDF files. Some examples will include ISIMIP impact models but also satellite products retrieve from COPERNICUS.
